# To complete this question, 
# you will make use of some concepts you've learned previously:
    # The select and map methods.
    # How to access an object property.
    # You'll also need to find out how to verify whether a string is the prefix for another string.
    # Use the to eq() RSpec matcher.
    # You'll test-drive a function search_candies that takes the following two arguments: 
    # a search string and a maximum price â€” 
    # and returns only the names of candies matching these criteria:
        # # the candy name starts by the search string
        # # the candy price is less than the maximum price

def search_candies(search_string, max_price)
    # this encapsulation of the candies hash would better be done with a class e.g #CadyShop 
    # which would initialise candies @candies = [...] and have a function #search_candies 
    # for security,readability, and ...
